        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p align="justify">
            This project is inspired by a research project conducted at Alibaba. Nowadays it's comparatively easy to query and analyze solely structured or unstructured data with recent developments in ML and representation learning. In practice, however, queries
            in analytical databases usually involve both structured and unstructured data. It remains a challenge in the industry to enable searching structured (i.e., related attributes) and unstructured data (i.e., feature vectors) in a hybrid and efficient
            manner. This research project aims to investigate and propose a better solution in this regard and implement a demo system.

        <h2>Research output</h2>
        <p align="justify">Technical Report: Coming soon!</p>
        <p align="justify">Quantization-based method has been adopted by Alibaba and Milvus, and we conduct relevant research. Study: [<a href="./resources/product quantization.pdf">link</a>]</p>

        <h2>Our proposed methods</h2>
        <p align="justify">We have implemented both VP-tree and Product Quantization (PQ) methods to enhance the efficiency of hybrid search utilizing Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNs). In the case of VP-tree, instead of treating vector search and attribute filtering
            as distinct stages, we propose a simultaneous application of both criteria. By considering both the location and size, we determine whether a house should be added to the list of interest. </p>
        <p align="justify">Regarding PQ, we propose the utilization of a pre-query method. We have proven its superiority as it allows us to perform attribute filtering prior to the inevitable distance calculation between each query vector and the corresponding pq-code.
            And pre-query would not sacriface the result of tok-k retrieval. And We find incorporating attribute filtering before the distance calculation process significantly improves the overall efficiency of the search, considering the in terms of
            speed and resource utilization
        </p>

        <h2>Demo system</h2>
        <p align="justify"><a href="https://connectpolyu-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/20084054d_connect_polyu_hk/ESdkK-WxpcVLmkY5PsCh4SIBWV56KonYMwo0UnOBz5p0ng?e=JKCTmt&nav=eyJyZWZlcnJhbEluZm8iOnsicmVmZXJyYWxBcHAiOiJTdHJlYW1XZWJBcHAiLCJyZWZlcnJhbFZpZXciOiJTaGFyZURpYWxvZyIsInJlZmVycmFsQXBwUGxhdGZvcm0iOiJXZWIiLCJyZWZlcnJhbE1vZGUiOiJ2aWV3In19">Video Link</a>            (This demo system is only used for testing numerous hybrid search methods with VP-tree and PQ, where text and image size is considered as structured data.) </p>
