        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p align="justify">
            This project is inspired by a research project conducted at Alibaba. Nowadays it's comparatively easy to query and analyze unstructured data with recent developments in ML and representation learning. In practice, however, queries in analytical databases
            usually involve both structured and unstructured data. It remains a challenge in the industry to enable searching structured (i.e., related attributes) and unstructured data (i.e., feature vectors) in a hybrid and efficient manner. This research
            project aims to propose a better solution in this regard and implement a demo system.
