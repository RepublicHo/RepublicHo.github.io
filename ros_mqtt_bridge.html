        Zhejun HE completed this project during his internship at the Hong Kong Center for Construction Robotics.

        <h2>Project Architecture</h2>
        <p align="justify">
            The project consists of three main components: an IoT device, a cloud platform, and a local host. The program are run in the localhost and device separately.
        </p>
        <li>The device with ROS and other capturing capabilities.</li>
        <li>A reliable cloud server with public IP. It doesn't matter which cloud you choose (e.g., AWS EC2, Aliyun ECS).</li>
        <li>The localhost should have Linux environment and ROS installed.</li>
        <p> The code is kept confidential.</p> <img src="./resources/RosMqttBridgeArchitecture.png" alt="Ros Mqtt Bridge Architecture Diagram" title="Ros Mqtt Bridge Architecture Diagram" width="700">
