                        <p>Proposed better architecture and algorithm for the hybrid search, which includes both structured and unstructured data retrieval, with better trade-offs among speed, accuracy and resources. </p>
                        <p>Working with Zhilin GAO and Supervised by <a href="https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csmlyiu/">Dr. Ken YIU</a>

                        <a>ROS MQTT bridge</a> [<a href="ros_mqtt_bridge.html ">link</a>]
                        <p> This project established bidirectional communication between the local host and the IoT device using MQTT bridges. For the IoT device we use, it is integrated with the ROS system and features a camera that can capture both point
                            cloud and image data. By enabling the algorithm, the device can process this data and publish it to the local ROS topic. This device can also transmit data over a network. Due to the unknown public IPs of both the IoT device
                            and the local host, as well as the large amount of data to be transferred and the unstable networking circumstances, we opted to to use the MQTT protocol to facilitate their long-range data transfer.

                        <p>Implemented numerous retrieval models, including Boolean, Fuzzy Boolean and Vector Space retrieval models, as well as an advanced model that we proposed and achieves better scores in average precision, R-precision and several aspects
                            for the long query. </p>

                        <p>Developed Website for Refugees in Hong Kong and Human Right topics. We worked closely with students from University of Maryland and Kyoto University to seek better ways to convey the content. We hope more and more Hong Kong people
                            can realize this global issue, and if possible, act with us to serve for those refugees, the home seekers.</p>

                    <li><a> Mindfulness meditation: Our mind could really benefit from it? </a>[<a href="./resources/Mindfulness meditation Our mind could really benefit from it.pdf ">study</a>]
                        <p> During my first year as an undergraduate, I conducted a comprehensive investigation into the potential side effects of mindfulness meditation. It is recommended that practitioners engage in mindfulness meditation under proper guidance
                            to mitigate the risk of negative side effects. </p>
