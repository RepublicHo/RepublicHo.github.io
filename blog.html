        <h1>愚見</h1>
        <p align="justify"> I have been trying to combine Spanish "alegría" (zest for life) with American belief in freedom, as well as Greek "eudaimonism", and Swiss efficiency. Hong Kong added the beauty of a multicultural society. And in my heart, I have always been Chinese.</p>

        <h2> Increating Cultural Difference, taking greetings in the morning for example</h2>
        <p>One cultural shock I had. </p>
        Let's compare these typical greetings in different languages.
        <ul>
            <li>汝好，飯食咯未（閩東語）</li>
            <li>你好，早晨，食咗饭未（粵語）</li>
            <li>您好，早安，飯吃了嗎（國語）</li>
            <li>Hey, great to see you! How are you doing these days?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There is no absolute standard for greetings. Different greetings show different characteristics of so many lovely people. But how to maintain this diversity and culture behind using CS techniques, I have always been thinking about it. No answer
            now. Using VR, or others?</p>
